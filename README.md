# CEE-Translation
This is the translation effort for Corsair Effects Engine.

# How to add a language
Simply add a new file based on the original en.xml, name it based on the two character language code for the language you'd like to translate, and change the strings in the file as you wish!
Never edit the Name attribute of an item; only edit the strings themselves.

# Controls
These are the caption/text/contents of controls, and the tooltips that appear when youhover over them in CEE. Items like ComboBoxes or UpDowns cannot have text, as the values the display are derived from other data. These data will eventually need to be translated as well, but CEE isn't ready for it yet.

# Messages
These are strings that we see in different places that aren't fixed to controls.

# Logs
These are strings that will be output to the logs. They include an ID as well, so that when I'm looking at logs from another language, I can easily identify what each line is. Never change these ID codes. For now, the messages don't need to be translated, as they're far from done.
